# DayTime Detector

This mod adds a new block to the Redstone tab that functions similarly to the Daylight Detector.

The purpose of this block is to provide an **alternative** to the standard Daylight Detector by using overworld's **dayTime data** instead of **skyLight**. This allows it to work even when:

- The block doesn't have a **direct view of the sky**.
- The block is in a **dimension** without a **day/night cycle**, such as **the Nether** or **the End**.
