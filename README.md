# DayTime Detector

This mod adds a new block to the Redstone Blocks tab that functions similarly to the Daylight Detector.

The purpose of this block is to provide an **alternative** to the standard Daylight Detector by using overworld's **dayTime data** instead of **skyLight**.

This allows it to work even when:

- The block doesnâ€™t receive **sky light**.
- The block is located in a **dimension** without a **day/night cycle**, such as **the Nether** or **the End**.
